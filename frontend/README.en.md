## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create `frontend/.env.local` (ignored by git) and configure:

```dotenv
# Base URL for the backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

If you deploy the backend elsewhere, update this URL accordingly.

## 🚀 Development

Install dependencies (Bun is recommended for this repo):

```bash
bun install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Additional scripts

```bash
bun run build   # Production build
bun run start   # Start Next.js in production mode (after build)
bun run lint    # Run ESLint checks
```

## 🔗 Backend Integration

The frontend expects the backend API to expose the following routes (see `backend/README.md` for details):

- `POST /api/auth/register` – Create a new account
- `POST /api/auth/login` – Obtain a JWT token
- `GET /api/profile` – Retrieve current user profile (requires Authorization header)
- `POST /api/designs` – Submit design data

Ensure your backend server is running on the same base URL configured in `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

## 🧪 Testing Account

A shared testing account is available:

- Email: `yeesiangku@gmail.com`
- Password: `123456`

Use it to quickly verify auth flows without creating a new user.
